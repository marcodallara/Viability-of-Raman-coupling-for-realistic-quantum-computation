# Viability-of-Raman-coupling-for-realistic-quantum-computation

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving field of quantum computing, the search for novel techniques to manipulate and control quantum states is unceasing. One such intriguing avenue is Raman coupling, a phenomenon that enables the dynamic coupling of two long-lived atomic levels, |0⟩ and |1⟩, which do not possess a direct dipole transition. This coupling is achieved by employing an intermediate level, |e⟩, which is strongly optically coupled to both |0⟩ and |1⟩ via electric dipole interactions. By carefully adjusting the detunings and amplitudes of two lasers, it becomes possible to induce a complete transition from |0⟩ to |1⟩ without significantly populating the short-lived intermediate level, albeit at second-order perturbation theory. Remarkably, the fast decay of the intermediate level seems to have little impact on the overall process.

## Project Objectives

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a project that aims to investigate the viability of Raman coupling for realistic quantum computation. The project is structured around a series of questions:

1. **Line Broadening and Interference:** Explore the behavior of spectral lines resulting from spontaneous emissions from level |e⟩ into each of the two lower-energy levels, |0⟩ and |1⟩. Investigate whether these spectral lines broaden and whether there is interference between the two emission processes.

2. **Lindblad Operators:** Transform the spontaneous emission line-broadening into a set of Lindblad (jump) operators and determine the number of operators required for an accurate model.

3. **Master Equation:** Construct the full master equation for a coupled three-level lambda/Raman system, incorporating the effects of spontaneous emission. Investigate the validity of the Rotating-Wave approximation and its limits.

4. **Temporal Dynamics:** Numerically integrate the master equation to explore the temporal dynamics of the system and identify regimes in which emission has a negligible impact. Compare results with initial expectations and interpretations.

5. **Beyond Spontaneous Emission:** Revisit the calculation of line broadening, considering a two-level atom with coherent properties instead of a photon vacuum. Discuss the implications in terms of stimulated emission and absorption.

6. **Open-Ended Exploration:** Address the open-system 3-level problem, incorporating all contributions: spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, and absorption into the Master Equation. Analyze the insights gained from this comprehensive approach.
